    "### Qudits\n",
    "Most of the time in quantum computation, we work with qubits, which are 2-level quantum systems. A qu-d-it is a generalization of a qubit to a d-level or d-dimension system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qudits with known values for d have specific names. A qubit has dimension 2, a qutrit has dimension 3, a ququart has dimension 4, and so on. In Cirq, qudits work exactly like qubits except they have a dimension attribute other than 2, and they can only be used with gates specific to that dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both qubits and qudits are represented by a Qid object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply a gate to some qudits, the dimensions of the qudits must match the dimensions it works on. For example, if a gate represents a unitary evolution on three qudits, a qubit, a qutrit, and another qutrit, the gate’s “qid shape” is (2, 3, 3) and its on method will accept exactly 3 Qids with dimension 2, 3, and 3."
