# Quantum-Programming
This repository has the code and my notebooks on Cirq Quantum Programming exercises primarily from the book "Quantum Computing an Applied Approach" by Jack Hidary. I highly recommend to read Cirq Tutorials as well to gain a better understanding of the programming constructs which Cirq uses.
